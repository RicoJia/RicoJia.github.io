description: A robot can draw like an artist! In this project, I drew a custom picture on a piece of letter size paper using a Rethink Sawyer Robot. The drawing process was conducted on a pixel by pixel basis, using <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/depth-first-search-or-dfs-for-a-graph">Depth First Search</a>. The drawing quality is further enhanced by a force control feature, so don't worry about bumpy or slanted surfaces! <br>For more information, check out my Github source code <a href="https://github.com/RicoJia/sawyer_picasso">Github Source Code</a>. <br>Also, don't forget to check out my Youtube channel for live demonstration! <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oZADOFXaMHI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
