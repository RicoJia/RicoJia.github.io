description: <br><br><p>The particle filter uses a dynamics model to predict where the Region of Interest (ROI) might be on each frame. That will restrict the search, and will reduce noise due to trajectory smoothness. Also, if a region with a better color histogram comes up later, even if thatâ€™s far from the current prediction, the particle filter may be able to quickly catch that. Mean-Shift trackers, however, may get stuck in the current region.
