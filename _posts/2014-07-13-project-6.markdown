description: In this project, I developed a 3R robot arm that can draw any shape within its workspace, for example a <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/HeartCurve.html">heart curve</a>. As part of the project, I implemented <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method">Newton-Raphson inverse kinematics algorithm</a> to solve for all joint angles given a marker position at a given time. Other simple continuous shapes, for example a line, a square, can be drawn too. <br><br> For more details, check out my <a href="https://github.com/RicoJia/Robot_Arm_Simulations"> Github Repo</a>.<br> Also, don't forget to check out a live demo of this project on my Youtube Channel <br><br><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TwYZKQe96Wo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
