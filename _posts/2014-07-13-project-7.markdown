description: Woody the Wood Inspector - the baby of my undergraduate Capstone Project at UBC. The purpose of this project is to facilitate the wood scanning process for quality control in the forestry industry. Presently, logs are trucked into specific scanning facilities for near-infrared, color-imaging, x-ray and other types of scans. With woody, a proof of concept wood scanning robot, this laborious process can be simplified. Woody can move in parallel to a straight surface and keep a certain distance from it. This way, onboard scanning devices can conduct high-quality scanning.
