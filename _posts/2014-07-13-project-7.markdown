description: <p> Woody the Wood Inspector - the baby of my undergraduate Capstone Project at UBC. The purpose of this project is to facilitate the wood scanning process for quality control in the forestry industry. Presently, logs are trucked into specific scanning facilities for near-infrared, color-imaging, x-ray and other types of scans. With woody, a proof of concept wood scanning robot, this laborious process can be simplified. Woody can move in parallel to a straight surface and keep a certain distance from it. This way, onboard scanning devices can conduct high-quality scanning. Due to intellectual property concerns, the code and detailed design of this project are confidential. However, feel free to contact me about the project. <br><br>Below is a typical log yard where parallel scanning takes place.</p><br><br><center><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39393023/72233532-8a967b00-358d-11ea-9499-5ccc0fb7253e.png" alt="Log Yard" width="800" ></center> <p>As an overview, The project is composed of:<ul><li>Traxxas Rustler 2WD 1/10 Scale RC Truck</li><li>Intel Nuc</li><li>PhidgetSpatial Precision 3/3/3 High Resolution</li><li>HC-SR04</li><li>Arduino Nano</li><li>DCDC-NUC Power Supply</li></ul></p>  <p><br<br> I designed and developed a controller that ensures constant scanning distance from the log, using linear state-space control techniques. Also, I implemented a linear Kalman Filter for fusing orientation readings from the ultrasonic sensors and the IMU.<br><br><center><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39393023/72233960-ed891180-358f-11ea-999c-0c2f2345c909.png" alt="Log Yard" width="800" ></center> </p><p> On top of our customized mobile platform, the robot can scan along a straight line, from a specified distance from the surface.
