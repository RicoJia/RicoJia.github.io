description: <br><br><p>In navigation, robotic mapping and odometry for virtual reality or augmented reality, simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) is the computational problem of constructing or updating a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of an agent's location within it. Due to its importance, it has been a hot research topic for years, and there is a variety of research papers in the recent years.</p><br><br><p>In this project, I implemented a light-weight simulator that can be used to verify landmark-based SLAM algorithms (EKF, UKF, landmark-based FastSLAM,etc. ). All essentials are provided, including simulation of an actual robot pose with Gaussian noise, landmark observations, laser scan data and visualization of the environment and frames. With this light-weight RViz based simulator, there is no need to turn on a heavy physics engine for verifying your SLAM algoithms!
